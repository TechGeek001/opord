							<p class="text-justify">My name is Andrew Zitter. I'm currently a 2LT with 1-505 PIR, 82nd Airborne Division. Although I'm an 11-series MOS, my college background is in web development, application security, and user experience (I build it, keep hackers out of it, and make it easy to use). I created this app because I noticed that there was a wide variety of products that my fellow LTs were creating, some of them more professional and complete than others. This program is meant to make better products - both OPORDs and graphics, which makes us look better in front of our higher commanders.</p>
